# Collections in Java

This project demonstrates various uses of Java collections such as `ArrayList`, `HashSet`, `PriorityQueue`, and `TreeMap`. It includes practical examples of how to:

- Add elements to different types of collections.
- Update and remove elements efficiently using iterators and loops.
- Iterate through collections, showcasing different traversal methods.

## Key Features:
- **ArrayList Manipulation**: Example of adding and deleting elements based on specific conditions.
- **HashSet Operations**: Handling unique elements with methods for insertion and deletion.
- **TreeMap Sorting**: Automatically sorts elements by key while allowing for efficient data retrieval.
- **PriorityQueue Update**: Efficient priority-based queue operations, including modifying elements.

This repository contains hands-on examples for anyone looking to understand Java's `Collections` framework better.
